## Explanation 
The most important thing to remember when you are asked to simplify algebraic fraction(s) is that they are JUST fraction(s), so you simply use your fraction skills.

The second thing to remember is to keep an eye out for clues as to how to factorise either the numerator and / or the denominator. This can save you time in an exam.

Algebraic fractions can be given as an expression to simplify or as an equation to solve.

You can also be asked to write an expression in the form $\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}$

This can look off-putting, but it is no different to asking you to simplify it.

The easiest way to explain what to do is by using examples.
## Examples
#### Examples where you asked to simplify an algebraic expression
### Example 1 – just factorising the numerator and denominator
| Maths                                     | Explanation                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simplify <br/>$$\frac{3x^2 + 9x}{x^2 -9}$$ | The numerator is easily factorised into $3x(x+3)$. The denominator is factorised using difference of squares                 |
| $$=\frac{3x(x+3)}{(x+3)(x-3)}$$           | You can then clearly see there is a factor of $(x+3)$ in both the<br/>numerator and denominator so they can be cancelled out. |
| $$=\frac{3x}{(x-3)}$$                     |                                                                                                                              |
### Example 2 – just factorising the numerator and denominator
| Maths                                           | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simplify<br/>$$ \frac{x^2 + 5x}{x^2 + 7x + 10}$$ | The numerator is easily factorised into $x(x+5)$.<br/><br/>As you have been asked to simplify the fraction it is almost certain that<br/>one of the factors in the denominator will be $x$ or $(x+5)$. |
| $$=\frac{x(x+5)}{(x+2)(x+5)}$$                  | Factorise the denominator.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| $$=\frac{x}{(x+2)}$$                            | $x+5$  is a factor in both the numerator and denominator so they can<br/>be cancelled out.                                                                                                           |
|                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
### Example 3 – dividing (or multiplying) algebraic fractions and then simplifying
| Maths                                                                            | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simplify fully <br/>$$ \frac{2x-2}{x+5} \div \frac{x^2 -4x +3}{2x^2 + 13x + 15}$$ | The first thing to do is the same as with any division fraction<br/>question: KFC (Keep Flip Change)                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| $$=\frac{2x-2}{x+5} \times \frac{2x^2 + 13x + 15}{x^2 -4x +3}$$                  | DONT multiply anything at this stage, just as with any multiplication fraction question take out any factors you can.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| $$=\frac{2(x-1)}{x+5} \times \frac{2x^2 + 13x + 15}{x^2 -4x + 3}$$               | Having done the easy factor in the numerator of the first fraction, and because you have been asked to simplify the expression, it is almost certain that in the second fraction one of the factors in the denominator will be 2 or $(x-1)$ and one of the factors in the numerator will be $(x+5)$ |
| $$=\frac{2(x+1)}{x+5} \times \frac{(2x+3)(x+5)}{(x-1)(x-3)}$$                    | Factorise the second fraction.<br/><br/>$(x + 5)$ and $(x - 1)$ are factors in both the numerator and<br/>denominator so they can be cancelled out.                                                                                                                                                    |
| $$=\frac{2}{1} \times \frac{(2x+3)}{(x-3)}$$                                     | Now you can multiply the fractions together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| $$=\frac{2(2x+3)}{(x-3)}$$                                                       | This is the answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| $$\frac{8}{3x-2} + \frac{6}{x+1}$$       | The first thing to do is the same as with any addition fraction<br/>question. Make a common denominator. |
| $$\frac{8(x+1) + 6(3x-2)}{(3x-2)(x+1)}$$ | Then just expand the numerator.                                                                         |
| $$=\frac{8x+8 + 18x -12}{(3x-2)(x+1)}$$  | and simplify it by collecting like terms.                                                               |
| $$=\frac{26x-4}{(3x-2)(x+1)}$$           | If appropriate, then factorise the numerator.                                                           |
| $$=\frac{2(13x-2)}{(3x-2)(x+1)}$$        |                                                                                                         |
#### Examples where you asked to solve an algebraic equation
### Example 5 – adding algebraic fractions and then solving
| Maths                                        | Explanation                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Solve $$\frac{8}{3x-2} + \frac{6}{x+1} = 2$$ | The first thing to do is the same as with any addition fraction<br/>question, make a common denominator and sort out the side with<br/>the fractions.                  |
| $$\frac{2(13x-2)}{(3x-2)(x+1)} = 2$$         | As the left hand side of this equation is the same as example 4, I have missed a few steps. <br/><br/>As both sides have 2 as a factor you can divide both sides by 2. |
| $$13x-2 = (3x-2) (x+1)$$                     | Then get rid of the denominator by multiplying both sides by it.                                                                                                     |
| $$13x-2 = 3x^2 +x -2$$                       | Expand the brackets on the right hand side.                                                                                                                          |
| $$0=3x^2 - 12x$$                             | Rearrange into the standard quadratic format.                                                                                                                        |
| $$0=3x(x-3)$$                                | So $x = 0$ or $4$                                                                                                                                                    |
