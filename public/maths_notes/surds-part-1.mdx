description: What are surds? Because surds look strange, a lot of people are scared of them. Actually they are quite straightforward and usually come with lots of marks. These notes look at how to handle them and include lots of examples.

Surds are square roots of numbers that do not have exact square roots, e.g. the square root of 2.
## What do surds look like?
The root sign, $\sqrt{}$ ,  can have a little number in it showing what type of root it is. For example $\sqrt[3]{}$ is a cube root (so not a surd).
Technically a square root would have a little 2, but no one bother with that. So if you just see a root sign without a little nubmer you can assume it is a square root.
If you have more than one term within the root sign, you normally just extend the line at the top and everything under the line is in a hidden bracket.
Square roots can also be written as an indice (i.e to the power of $\frac{1}{2}$ ) but when dealing with surds you use the root sign.
## Adding Surds
Just like in algebra a number snuggled up in front of the root sign means you have lots of that type of surd.
For example $3\sqrt{7}$ means you have three lots of $\sqrt{7}$,i.e $\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{7} + \sqrt{7}$ or $3 \times \sqrt{7}$ 
Similarly you can only add like surds.
For example

| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $$2\sqrt{5} + 6\sqrt{5} = 8\sqrt{5}$$               | I have $2$ lots of $\sqrt{5}$ and add another $6$ lots of $\sqrt{5}$, so in total I have $8$ lots of $\sqrt{5}$, i.e. $8\sqrt{5}$ |
| $$2\sqrt{5} + 6\sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{5} + 6\sqrt{3}  $$ | I can’t combine √5 and √3 by adding, just like I can’t combine<br/>a and b by adding in algebra.                                   |
## Multiplying and Splitting Surds
You can multiply surds together, combining them under the same square root sign.
For example  $\sqrt{5} \times \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{15}$ 
Similarly you could split a surd in two (useful when simplifying surds).
For example  $\sqrt{15} = \sqrt{5} \times \sqrt{3}$ 
REMEMBER squaring the square root of a number gives you the number:
$\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{a} = \sqrt{a^2} = a$
## Simplifying Surds
To simplify a surd you split the number into factors, but you are only looking for factors that are square numbers, e.g. 4, 9, 16, 25, 36. This is because you can take them out of the square root sign. Below are a few examples to help you:

| $$\sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{3}$$ | Split the surd                                                                                                                                                          |

| $$ \sqrt{50} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{2}$$ | Split the surd - you don’t need to write this step down.                                                                                                                  |

| Simply $\sqrt{48}$                   | Does 48 have any of the special factors?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| $$\sqrt{48} = \sqrt{(16 \times 3)}$$ | 48 has several factor pairs: 1&48, 2&24, 3&16, 4&12, 6&8.<br/>Two of these factor pairs contain one of the special factors.<br/>If you can see both, choose the pair with the larger special<br/>factor. If you can only see the smaller one, that is fine, you<br/>will still get to the right answer, but will need an extra step.<br/>This is shown in the next example. |
| $$ \sqrt{48} = 4\sqrt{3}$$           | Take the special factor out of the root sign                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
### Example 4
| Maths                                           | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simply $\sqrt{48}$                              | Does 48 have any of the special factors?                                                                                                                                                     |
| $$\sqrt{48} = \sqrt{(4 \times 12)}$$            | This time we can only see one factor pair containing one of<br/>the special factors: 4&12.                                                                                                    |
| $$\sqrt{48} = 2\sqrt{12}$$                      | Take the special factor out of the root sign.<br/>Check whether the number left in the root sign has any<br/>special factors - this time it does, $4 \times 3$, so we can simplify<br/>further! |
| $$\sqrt{48} = 2 \sqrt{(4 \times 3)}$$           | Take the new special factor out of the root sign.                                                                                                                                            |
| $$\sqrt{48} = 2 \times 2\sqrt{3} = 4 \sqrt{3}$$ | So you get the same either way (which is a relief).                                                                                                                                          |
## Special factors can appear part way through a question
Special factors can appear when you combine surds by multiplying. 
For example neither $\sqrt{6}$ or $\sqrt{3}$ have special factors so they cannot be simplified. However, when you multiple $\sqrt{6}$  and $\sqrt{3}$ together you get $\sqrt{18}$ and that does. So when you have multiplied surds together, recheck for special factors and, if they are there,
simplify.

$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{6}  \times \sqrt{3} &=  \sqrt{18}\\ &= \sqrt{(9 \times 2)} \\ &= 3\sqrt{2}\end{aligned}$$

## Cancelling Surds
If you look at a number like 3√2, the factors are 3 and √2, so if you have either of these factors in the numerator and denominator of a fraction you can cancel them out. For example
| Maths                                | Explanation                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $$ \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 3 $$ | You can cancel the √2 as it is in both the numerator and denominator |

Also if you have a surd over a surd you can combine the square root signs as shown, which can make cancelling easier to see. $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}}$ can be written as $$\sqrt{\frac{2}{6}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$$
