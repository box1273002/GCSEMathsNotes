When asked to prove something you need to use generic integers, e.g. n.
State what your generic numbers will be.
Common ones you might need to use are:
- $n$ is any integer
-  $2n$ is any even integer
-  $2n+1$ is any odd integer
-  $n$, $n+1$, $n+2$ are consecutive integers
-  $2n$, $2n+2$, $2n+4$ etc are consecutive even integers
-  $2n+1$, $2n+3$, $2n+5$ etc are consecutive odd integers
-  $3n$ is a multiple of $3$, $4n$ is a multiple of $4$ etc
If you are asked to consider unrelated integers, they must be based on a different letter. For
example:
- 2 unrelated integers, then use $m$ and $n$.
- 2 unrelated even integers, then use $2m$ and $2n$.
- 2 unrelated odd integers, then use $2m+1$ and $2n+1$.
Related integers will be when the position of one is related to the position of the other, e.g. they are
multiples of each other, are consecutive, powers of each other etc.
Also you might be asked to show something is a multiple of something or has a certain remainder
when divided by something:
- If you have to show something is a multiple of, say, $8$, then $8$ must be a factor.
-  If you need to show something is an even integer, then $2$ must be a factor
- If you need to show something is an odd integer, you must be able to show there is a
remainder of $1$ when divided by $2$.
## Examples
### Example 1 - Prove the product of three consecutive odd numbers is odd
| Maths                                                                                            | Explanation                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $2n + 1$, $2n + 3$, $2n + 5$ are three consecutive odd numbers                                   | State what your three consecutive odd numbers are                                                                                                                         |
| Their product is $(2n + 1)(2n + 3)(2n + 5)$                                                      | Do what the proof is asking you to do to these numbers (in this case multiply them together.                                                                              |
| $$\begin{aligned} &= (2n + 1)(4n^2 + 16n + 15)\\&= 8n^3  +32n^2+ 30n + 4n^2 + 16n + 15\end{aligned}$$ | At this point you can immediately say that<br/>everything is always divisible by 2 except the<br/>15, which is odd and not dependant on n, so<br/>the product is always odd. |
| $$\begin{aligned}&= 8n^3 + 36n^2 + 46n + 15\\&=2(4n^3 + 18n^2 + 23n + 7) + 1\end{aligned}$$      | OR you can collect like terms and then say<br/>when divided by 2 there is a remainder of 1,<br/>so it is odd                                                                |
### Example 2 - Prove (2n + 1)(3n - 2) - (6n- 1)(n - 2) is always even
| Maths                                   | Explaination                                                                                                                     |
| :-------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $$(2n + 1)(3n - 2) - (6n- 1)(n - 2) $$  | Do what the proof is asking you to do to<br/>these numbers.                                                                       |
| $$= (6n^2 - n - 2) - (6n^2 - 13n +2) $$ | Keep both sections in brackets. This is<br/>important as the last bit has a negative sign<br/>outside the bracket.                 |
| $$= 6n^2 - n - 2 - 6n^2 + 13n -2$$      | Remove the brackets, remembering the<br/>negative sign outside the second bracket<br/>changes the signs currently in that bracket. |
| $$=12n-4$$                              | Collect like terms                                                                                                               |
| $$=2(6n-2)$$                            | Every even number has 2 as a factor, so show<br/>the expression has a factor of 2.                                                |
